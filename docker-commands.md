# Containers

## Lifecycle

docker create		// creates a container but does not start it.
docker rename		// allows the container to be renamed.
docker run			// creates and starts a container in one operation.
docker rm			// deletes a container.
docker update		// updates a container's resource limits.


## Starting and Stopping

docker start		// starts a container so it is running.
docker stop			// stops a running container.
docker restart		// stops and starts a container.
docker pause		// pauses a running container, "freezing" it in place.
docker unpause		// will unpause a running container.
docker wait			// blocks until running container stops.
docker kill			// sends a SIGKILL to a running container.
docker attach		// will connect to a running container.


## Info

docker ps		// shows running containers.
docker logs		// gets logs from container. (You can use a custom log driver, but logs is only available for json-file and journald in 1.10).
docker inspect	// looks at all the info on a container (including IP address).
docker events	// gets events from container.
docker port		// shows public facing port of container.
docker top		// shows running processes in container.
docker stats	// shows containers' resource usage statistics.
docker diff		// shows changed files in the container's FS.

docker ps -a shows running and stopped containers.

docker stats --all shows a running list of containers.


## BUILD

Build an image from the Dockerfile in the current
directory and tag the image
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .

List all images that are locally stored with the Docker
engine
docker images

Delete an image from the local image store
docker rmi alpine:3.4

## SHIP

Pull an image from a registry
docker pull alpine:3.4

Retag a local image with a new image name and tag
docker tag alpine:3.4 myrepo/myalpine:3.4

Log in to a registry (the Docker Hub by default)
docker login my.registry.com:8000

Push an image to a registry
docker push myrepo/myalpine:3.4

## RUN

docker run
	--rm			remove container automatically after it exits
	 -it			connect the container to terminal
	--name web		name the container
	-p 5000:80		expose port 5000 externally and map to port 80
	-v~/dev:/code	create a host mapped volume inside the container
	alpine:3.4		the image from which the container is instantiated
	/bin/sh			the command to run inside the container

Stop a running container through SIGTERM
docker stop web

Stop a running container through SIGKILL
docker kill web

Create an overlay network and specify a subnet
docker network create --subnet 10.1.0.0/24
--gateway 10.1.0.1 -d overlay mynet

List the networks
docker network ls

List the running containers
docker ps

Delete all running and stopped containers
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

Create a new bash process inside the container and connect
it to the terminal
docker exec -it web bash

Print the last 100 lines of a containerâ€™s logs
docker logs --tail 100 web
