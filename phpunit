## Windows
Globally installing the PHAR involves the same procedure as manually installing Composer on Windows:

Create a directory for PHP binaries; e.g., C:\bin

Append ;C:\bin to your PATH environment variable (related help)

Download https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit-6.5.phar and save the file as C:\bin\phpunit.phar

Open a command line (e.g., press Windows+R » type cmd » ENTER)

Create a wrapping batch script (results in C:\bin\phpunit.cmd):
```
C:\Users\username> cd C:\bin
C:\bin> echo @php "%~dp0phpunit.phar" %* > phpunit.cmd
C:\bin> exit
```
Open a new command line and confirm that you can execute PHPUnit from any path:
```
C:\Users\username> phpunit --version
PHPUnit x.y.z by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.
```
For Cygwin and/or MingW32 (e.g., TortoiseGit) shell environments, you may skip step 5. above, simply save the file as phpunit (without .phar extension), and make it executable via chmod 775 phpunit.


## Fix: PHPUnit not working with Git Bash in Windows
If you installed PHPUnit to a Windows machine, but are seeing something like this when running phpunit in Git Bash:
```
$ phpunit ––version
bash: /c/bin/phpunit: No such file or directory
```
Then make a duplicate copy of your phpunit.phar file:
```
C:\bin\phpunit.phar
```
And rename the copy to:
```
C:\bin\phpunit
```
PHPUnit should work fine in Git Bash after that, as well as in Windows cmd or PowerShell.

Note: If you don’t care about running it in Windows cmd or PowerShell, then just rename the original phpunit.phar file to phpunit rather than making a copy.
